          <p>
            OYO-tal was founded in 2023 with a simple but powerful idea: what if patients could skip the queue and
            find the best healthcare providers in their area?
          </p>
          <p>
            Our platform was built by healthcare professionals and technology experts who understand the challenges
            patients face when seeking medical care.
